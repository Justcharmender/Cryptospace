Blockchain is the innovative database technology that’s at the heart of nearly all cryptocurrencies. By distributing identical copies of a database across an entire network, blockchain makes it very difficult to hack or cheat the system.

A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.

•	Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
•	As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
•	Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. 
•	In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
•	Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

# Working.
The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).

# Transparency
Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could track Bitcoin wherever it goes. 

For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.
Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair). As a result, users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.

Information architecture is about organizing content inside a software product in a way that people can interact with it without thinking. This way, UX experts have to work out a flow that will allow customers to find what they need as fast as possible, navigating between screens or pages without effort. 
# User interface
The majority of cryptocurrency applications offer their users a lot of complex information. Crypto trading platforms, for instance, contain domain terminology and comprehensive quote charts. As a result, it may be challenging for users, especially non-professional traders and investors, to interact with the product and perceive content. With the goal to prevent confusion of customers, it is important to develop an intuitive UI when making a crypto app design. 
Focusing on clarity and simplicity, UI experts need to make each screen serve a certain purpose. What’s more, the user interface should not be overcrowded with graphic elements (buttons, icons, pop-up windows, and others). In addition, we recommend that you keep a color palette concise and not too bright in order not to draw user attention away from solution functionality and information. So, designers generally use contrasting colors to only highlight the most important information or call-to-actions.

# Design for trust and security
While the digital currency market is growing at a rapid pace, a lot more users start buying digital coins and carry out crypto transactions. However, as cryptocurrency apps are subject to hacker attacks and data breaches, the security must be of the highest priority. If a crypto solution does not provide sufficient protection of customer information and accounts, a company may lose not only enormous amounts of money but clients and reputation. 
With this aim in view, companies need to implement functionality like two-factor authentication, email verification, data encryption, and biometrics (facial, fingerprints, or behavior recognition). The worldwide leading crypto exchange platform Coinbase, for example, asks customers to verify their accounts using an identity card, driver license, or passport.

Concerning other valuable features, organizations can set up IP address monitoring to instantly message users if there is a sign in from an unknown device, browser, or geographic location not identified by the system before. Notified about suspicious authorization, customers will be able to instantly block their accounts and prevent fraud.
# Final words
Crypto app design is an important project stage, vital to ensuring a seamless customer experience and a feeling of security. Here are some key points we would like to highlight for you to sum the things up:
•	Prior to design, it is crucial to research end-user goals to tailor the application accordingly.
•	By working out a convenient information architecture, a company can provide smooth navigation between screens, enabling users to find what they search for as quickly as possible.
•	With proper visualization of crypto data, an organization will increase customer satisfaction and prevent churn.
•	The use of trust signals will raise credibility in your services.
•	Educational content will help you attract non-professional traders and generate higher profit.
•	By explaining the cryptocurrency advantages to users, you will eliminate the fear of the unknown.
At Surf, we have considerable experience in building fintech products, including crypto applications. To deliver software that meets user goals and expectations, we identify and segment the target audience, discover the pain points and preferences of each group, as well as conduct competitor analysis. 
We also perform user testing to find out whether real people enjoy the product and what can be improved. This thoughtful approach allowed us to implement a number of successful projects, involving Twim. Launched a few years ago, Twim outrun many popular rival solutions of the time due to its modern crypto app design and a great UX.
